'''
A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements. 
Basic uses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. 
Set objects also support mathematical operations like union, 
intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

#first way to create set
var_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
#second way: the elements will be randomized
funct_set = set('iterable')
print(dir(set('test')))
print(var_set)
print(funct_set)
