Sorting Visualizer:
Create a program that visualizes sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, or Merge Sort in action. You can use a library like Pygame to create a graphical representation of how these algorithms work.

Pathfinding Visualizer:
Build a tool to visualize pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra's Algorithm or A* Search. Allow users to create mazes and watch the algorithm find the shortest path.

Data Structure Implementations:
Implement common data structures like Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Trees, or Hash Tables from scratch. You can then use these data structures in other projects or compare their performance to Python's built-in data structures.

Text Search Engine:
Create a simple search engine that can index and search through a collection of documents. Implement algorithms like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for ranking search results.

Maze Generator and Solver:
Build a maze generator that uses algorithms like Randomized Prim's Algorithm or Recursive Backtracking. Then, implement a solver that finds the path from the start to the finish of the generated maze.

Graph Algorithms:
Implement graph algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to solve problems like finding connected components in a graph or determining if a graph is bipartite.

Encryption and Decryption:
Create a program that encrypts and decrypts messages using common encryption algorithms like Caesar Cipher, Vigen√®re Cipher, or even more advanced ones like RSA.

Game Development:
Develop classic games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Chess, or Sudoku. Implement the game logic and use algorithms for AI opponents if applicable.

Numeric Algorithms:
Work on algorithms for numerical problems, such as implementing Newton's method for finding roots of equations or creating a calculator that supports complex mathematical operations.

Machine Learning Models from Scratch:
Implement basic machine learning algorithms like linear regression, k-means clustering, or a simple neural network using libraries like NumPy.

Text-Based Adventure Game:
Design a text-based adventure game with branching storylines. Implement algorithms for handling player choices and tracking progress.

Image Processing Filters:
Create image processing filters such as grayscale conversion, edge detection, or blurring using common image processing algorithms like convolution.

Web Scraper and Analyzer:
Build a web scraper that collects data from websites and analyzes it using algorithms for text analysis or sentiment analysis.

Genetic Algorithm Simulator:
Create a simulator for genetic algorithms to solve optimization problems. Apply it to tasks like evolving a population to find the best solution.

Natural Language Processing (NLP):
Work on projects related to NLP, such as text summarization, language translation, or sentiment analysis using libraries like NLTK or spaCy.
